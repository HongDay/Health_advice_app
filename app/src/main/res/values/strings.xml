        The app will go through a 3-day optimization period to better predict your lifestyle and give you thorough feedback.\n During this period, you will be periodically asked simple questions about your health, and the more quickly and accurately you answer them, the more accurate the app will be.\n After the 3-day optimization period, there will be sessions twice a day where you can manually fix errors before receiving feedback, and the server will continue to optimize for you.\n Do you agree to actively participate in the optimization period survey?
